# Travelling-Salesman
Results of attempting to tackle the travelling salesman problem

I spent a day trying to come up with ways to solve the travelling salesman problem and compare my results to Mathematica's built in FindShortestRoute function. Unsurprisingly, Mathematica's function outperforms my methods, having a total distance that is roughly 90% as large as I was able to achieve on average.
